Current Project: 
* Testing velocity 
      * add a adjustment for when there is a change more than something (Done) 
            * if it does not work as well it is ok for now 
      * Add a counter for the number of hit (Done)
      * Show special colour variation for when a hit is landed. (Done) 
            * Use maybe add an additional sometime to the yoyo locations when we add it 
            * instead of using hte existing trail, we need a new effect frame
      * Add a score number to show on screen (Done)
      * add option to enable enter to continue mode

Next:
  * Clean up code 
  * Try direction change approach 
  * Learn more advanced string tracking


Some ideas for how to do this:
1) Track the hands as well and determine interaction with the string as like yoyo crossing or coming close to the hands (might not work in some tricks)
2) Calculate interactions with the string as change of direction of yoyo, or change of velocity (I am exploring this)
3) Try to learn lane line tracking and see if that works.
4) Adjust colours so that the string is very obvious (still does not explain how to track the string)
5) split the string as 1cm segments and track each dot individually LOL



--------------------
*) Identify params that impacts tracking
ans: all params are for the visual effects 


3) try different tracking algorithms provided by cv? (Tried. Original one is better)
ans: No other algorithm seemed to be better. A way to improve tracking was to draw the bounding box better.
