Random Notes:
 * Transitioning to adding visual effects etc 




Next:

  * Create a colour picker that works on an image. Then create a colour picker that works on a video
  
  * We can also add visual effects to the yoyo and string such as outlines etc. THis works really well! 
  * I think we can just use colour thresholding:
    * Flow goes like this: 
      * Find colour threshold for string
      * Choose effect 
      * Find colour threshold for yoyo 
      * Choose effect


  * Now we can do some calculations of the positions of the string and the yoyo etc 

Some ideas for how to do this:
1) Track the hands as well and determine interaction with the string as like yoyo crossing or coming close to the hands (might not work in some tricks)
2) Calculate interactions with the string as change of direction of yoyo, or change of velocity (I am exploring this)
3) Try to learn lane line tracking and see if that works.
4) Adjust colours so that the string is very obvious (still does not explain how to track the string)
5) split the string as 1cm segments and track each dot individually LOL



--------------------
*) Identify params that impacts tracking
ans: all params are for the visual effects 


3) try different tracking algorithms provided by cv? (Tried. Original one is better)
ans: No other algorithm seemed to be better. A way to improve tracking was to draw the bounding box better.
